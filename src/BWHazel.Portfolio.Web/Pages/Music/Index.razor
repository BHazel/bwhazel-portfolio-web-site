        I have always loved music, whether it be listening to it, playing or singing it or even composing it! In this section you can find some of the music I have composed.

    My composing journey started from my early schooldays where I performed an unnamed piece, with inspirations from <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, the theme to <em>The Crystal Maze</em>*, amongst others, on the piano in a concert at the age of 7. For some unknown reason at the time I said it had 33 verses although I certainly did not play that number!

    At secondary school we were lucky enough to have experience with music technology as part of our regular music lessons, from which <em>Trumpet Fanfare</em>, which you can view here, was composed.  The software was the very powerful <em>Steinberg Cubasis</em>, of which I was given its <em>Notation</em> variant optimised for musical notation as a Christmas present.  At that time the GCSE Music coursework required writing 3 compositions, 2 of which, <em>Wind in Harmony</em> and <em>Summer Dusk</em>, you can view here.  The third, <em>Ring of Sauron</em>, as the name implies, was heavily inspired by <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> as it was 2002 at the time so the film trilogy was in full swing!  I wrote it for piano and SATB choir and was extremely lucky my parents and some parents and staff at one of their schools were very kind to perform it with me on piano for a recording!

    It was also during my GCSEs that I underwent some emergency surgery on my back which meant I was unable to attend school for several weeks to recover.  As a reward for continuing to work on school assignments from home my parents very kindly bought me a copy of <em>Sibelius</em>, the very powerful software used by the professionals!  Compositions do not always have to be written in one go or one at a time: I find I get an idea and jot it down, whether it is a phrase or something to experiment.  I then go back to it and develop it from there!  I often had, and still have, lots of open compositions waiting for the next spark of inspiration to hit!

    GCSEs led to A-levels and I undertook a complete A-level in music, only writing 1 composition over the 2 year period, <em>Fete Galante</em>, which you can also view here.  At this point, I have to confess, my composing took a back seat as I headed to University to undertake a degree in chemistry, however, my musical involvement did not stop!  It was, however, during my time at University that I gradually migrated from PC to Mac and discovered <em>Apple GarageBand</em> which led to the composition of <em>Four Forces</em>, an electronica suite based on the four forces of nature.  It was released onto the <em>iTunes Store</em> in early 2008 and is also now available on numerous streaming services including <em>Apple Music</em> and <em>Spotify</em>!
