        My primary creative skills are in music and coding but I am developing my skills in graphic design!  In this section you can find some of the creations I have made, most of which are exploratory!

    When it comes to graphic creative skills I have never excelled!  I remember when I was 13 drawing a floor lamp to see if I should take art GCSE: the result looked more like a stick insect so that decision was made there and then!  However, in recent years I have started to develop my skills in the graphics side, both physically and digitally.

    The first piece of graphics software I used was during my school days and was the short-lived, but very versatile, <em>Microsoft PhotoDraw</em>, the graphics editor for <em>Microsoft Office</em>, which I used for schoolwork, posters and basic web graphics for many years long into my University days.  For web development at the time I used <em>Microsoft FrontPage</em>, also part of <em>Microsoft Office</em>.  Sadly this too was also retired during my early University days but I held out for a few years until my PhD when I finally moved on!

    From <em>Microsoft FrontPage</em> I moved to <em>Microsoft Visual Studio</em> and have never looked back!  From <em>Microsoft PhotoDraw</em> I briefly moved to the also somewhat short-lived <em>Microsoft Expression</em> but finally settled on <em>Adobe Creative Suite</em>, specifically <em>Adobe Fireworks</em>, a tool with many functional similarities to <em>Microsoft PhotoDraw</em>.

    Moving forward to my professional years I have focused mainly on developing my skills in <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> and <em>Adobe Illustrator</em>, while on the mobile side I have also dabbled with <em>Adobe Fresco</em>!  Most recently I have also started exploring <em>SideFX Houdini</em> to develop skills in 3D graphics and animation!  Overall, to be honest, developing the skills is going slowly but with each creation I can feel the skills improving!  You can see examples of some of my creations in all of these tools here.

    As to physical graphics I have started to improve my drawing skills.  After following a tutorial on drawing a human eye I realised I actually can draw after all!  As with the digital graphics it is going slowly but fun to see a creation come to life!
